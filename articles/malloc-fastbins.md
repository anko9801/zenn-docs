/*
   Fastbins

    An array of lists holding recently freed small chunks.  Fastbins
    are not doubly linked.  It is faster to single-link them, and
    since chunks are never removed from the middles of these lists,
    double linking is not necessary. Also, unlike regular bins, they
    are not even processed in FIFO order (they use faster LIFO) since
    ordering doesn't much matter in the transient contexts in which
    fastbins are normally used.

    Chunks in fastbins keep their inuse bit set, so they cannot
    be consolidated with other free chunks. malloc_consolidate
    releases all chunks in fastbins and consolidates them with
    other free chunks.

   FASTBIN_CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD is the size of a chunk in free()

   fastbin chunks. This is a heuristic, so the exact value should not
   matter too much. It is defined at half the default trim threshold as a
   compromise heuristic to only attempt consolidation if it is likely
   to lead to trimming. However, it is not dynamically tunable, since
   consolidation reduces fragmentation surrounding large chunks even
   if trimming is not used.

/*
  TRIM_FASTBINS controls whether free() of a very small chunk can
  immediately lead to trimming. Setting to true (1) can reduce memory
  footprint, but will almost always slow down programs that use a lot
  of small chunks.

  Define this only if you are willing to give up some speed to more
  aggressively reduce system-level memory footprint when releasing
  memory in programs that use many small chunks.  You can get
  essentially the same effect by setting MXFAST to 0, but this can
  lead to even greater slowdowns in programs using many small chunks.
  TRIM_FASTBINS is an in-between compile-time option, that disables
  only those chunks bordering topmost memory from being placed in
  fastbins.
